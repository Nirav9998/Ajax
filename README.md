--This repo contains the codes of ajax for real application like 
"provide suggestion using ajax,automatic fill of checkbox like when we select the country, 
then the city under that country will automatically filled in the city drop downn box etc.."

--This files are using html,php,ajax,javascript,jquery technology.

--To run this all files make sure you have installed the campo,wamp,lamp any one of the software.

--Now to get the files work in your pc I will recommend you to download xampp server after download  
and installation complete locate the folder htdocs folder inside the xampp folder paste the code inside
this it now you have to create the database for this you have to first open the service for apache and phpmyadmin 
From the Xampp control panel just open it and click on start button in apache and phpmyadmin option,after start service
For creating database open browser and type localhost/phpmyadmin then panel will open create the database that I have used
In the files and once created you are done

--after above step open the browser and type localhost/project folder name that you have created inside htdocs folder inside 
the xampp folder.

-- it's done you will see some well know use of ajax like without reloading Page things will done in background by ajax and 
many more.   -----  Best of luck  :) -----
